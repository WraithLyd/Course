After the busy examination weeks, my spare time get more and more. Therefore, more plans and rules must be set.

+ Cut down the time spent on social media and choose some important friends to chat. Based on 3-5 hours in the previous time, I am supposed to spend an hour is well. The more serious cut can be implied in future. 
+ Decide what to do on the phone to improve myself. It takes me plenty of time on the phone. So that a number of useless chat should be cut off. Learning some courses in bilibili or reading some published books and news are selected. 
+ Do tasks in time. Don't push them to due. 
+ Make a timetable.
